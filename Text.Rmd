#Specification
##ln(GDP)= beta1 + beta2 * trade + alpha * X + error

GDP: per worker; in usd
trade: (export + import) / total GDP

X: control variables for working population in thousands (lnPOP) and area in milesÂ²

# Test
We want to establish whether *trade* has a positive impact on *GDP per worker*
=> one-sided test with

H0 : beta2 <= 0

H1 : beta2 > 0 (our hypothesis)
